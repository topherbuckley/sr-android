# APKDistribution (Milestone 6)

Reevaluate the release distribution method for APK files. Currently releases can only be published from my personal fork due to lack of write permissions to OIST’s GitHub release storage. Propose adopting an alternative service such as JitPack (or similar) to host APK releases in an automated, reliable, and traceable manner, enabling continuous delivery without relying on personal repositories.
