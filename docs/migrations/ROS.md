# ROS

Implement ROS-based communication between the firmware/Android system and the host environment. This includes updating or redesigning the existing FlatBuffer communication layer so that message definitions and transport patterns align with ROS conventions and can integrate cleanly with ROS nodes, tools, and debugging workflows.

TODO:
Add link to ROS documentation and specific things that should be implemented
